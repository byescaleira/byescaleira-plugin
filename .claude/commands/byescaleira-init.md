# /byescaleira-init

Generate the byescaleira universal repository skeleton in the current directory.

## Steps

1. Confirm or ask for the project codename from the byescaleira space dictionary.
   Main projects: Apollo, Artemis, Voyager, Pioneer, Nova, Orion, Kepler, Hubble, Sputnik, Galileo, Osiris, Titan.
2. If the current directory already contains skeleton files, ask before overwriting.
3. Create the structure described below.
4. Fill each file using the templates below, replacing `<project>` with the chosen codename and `<description>` with a one-line summary.
5. Use English for all generated documentation.
6. Apply the byescaleira voice (direct, personal, no corporate fluff).
7. Add the README signature at the end of README.md.
8. Suggest a commit message: `chore: bootstrap <project> repository skeleton`.
9. Do NOT generate source code yet. Only the definitions layer.

## Structure to create

```

If the project uses CI scripts, create them as executable placeholders:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# setup.sh — install dependencies
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# lint.sh — run linters
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# test.sh — run tests
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# build.sh — build the project
```

Note: the CI workflow gracefully skips missing scripts (`|| echo "No ... script"`), so placeholders are safe but not strictly required.
