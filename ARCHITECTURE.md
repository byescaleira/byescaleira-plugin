# Architecture: byescaleira plugin

## Overview

The byescaleira plugin is now packaged as a Claude Code native plugin. It exposes:

- `SKILL.md` — loaded as a skill inside Claude Code sessions.
- `agents/byescaleira.md` — specialist agent invoked with `@byescaleira`.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest declaring the plugin components.
- Legacy `.claude/` files for users who prefer the older extension format.

It is intentionally lightweight: no compiled code, no external runtime dependencies beyond Claude Code itself. The goal is portability and easy installation.

## Goals

1. **Consistency** — every project follows the same skeleton and conventions.
2. **Actionability** — rules are available at the moment of creation.
3. **Modularity** — easy to extend with new commands or agents later.
4. **Portability** — installable by copying files into `~/.claude/`.

## Non-goals

- Complex build systems.
- Cross-platform support beyond Claude Code.
- Automated enforcement of rules (hooks may be added later).

## Conventions

- All documentation is in English.
- All codenames are in English and follow the space theme.
- File names are lowercase with hyphens.
- Markdown files are readable by both humans and Claude Code.

## Installation Flow

1. User installs the plugin via Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude plugin install byescaleira
   ```
   or directly from the repository:
   ```bash
   claude plugin install git@github.com:byescaleira/byescaleira-plugin.git
   ```
2. Claude Code places the plugin in `~/.claude/skills/byescaleira/`.
3. On the next session, the skill, agent, and hooks are loaded automatically.

A legacy install path is still available via `scripts/install.sh` for users who prefer the older `~/.claude/` extension format.

## Current state

- `SKILL.md` is the primary entry point for the native plugin.
- `agents/byescaleira.md` provides a specialist agent.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares the plugin manifest.
- Legacy `.claude/` files remain for backward compatibility.
- `DESIGN.md` contains the visual and brand definitions.

## Future Evolution

- Publish to a Claude Code marketplace if/when Anthropic opens a public one.
- Strengthen CI with markdown lint, shellcheck, and frontmatter validation.
